# Overview

Emu8086 combines an advanced source editor, assembler, disassembler, software emulator (Virtual PC) with debugger, and step by step tutorials. This program is extremely helpful for those who just begin to study assembly language. It compiles the source code and executes it on emulator step by step.

# Inspect
Once you open the app you will see a registartion button

_main window_

Click the button will open a small window with another button to buy a license with the followin links

```
All of them are not working and i have done some search to make sure that this program is not maintained any more

Fishing out inspection by trying to register with dummy name and key

# x32gdb

Start x32gdb while emu is running and attach it to the the debugger

![Attach to debugger](/assets/img/posts/emu1/4.png)
_Attach to debugger_

![Select program to attach](/assets/img/posts/emu1/5.png)
_Select program to attach_

Then from select `view -> Modules` to list all the loaded modules

![Modules](/assets/img/posts/emu1/6.png)
_Modules_

After this double click emu8086.exe

![emu8086.exe](/assets/img/posts/emu1/7.png)
_emu8086.exe_


Now right click `search for -> current module -> string refrences`

![find strings](/assets/img/posts/emu1/8.png)
_find strings_

Seaching for `Wrong registartion key` as this message was shown to us

![find registartion strings](/assets/img/posts/emu1/9.png)
_find registartion string_

Double click it to show it in the program assembly and pressing `Ctrl+A` to analyze the module

And notice there is a jump to the instruction just before our string usage

![jump destination](/assets/img/posts/emu1/10.png)
_jump destination_

Scrolling to the jump instruction and the jump is based on a value stored at the address `621470`

![jump source](/assets/img/posts/emu1/11.png)
_jump source_

Right click the address select `follow in dump -> constant emu8086.00621470`

![memory value](/assets/img/posts/emu1/12.png)
_memory value_

Right click the memory and search for refrences

![Find Refrences](/assets/img/posts/emu1/13.png)
_Find Refrences_

The last refrence is looking promising ;)

![Refrences List](/assets/img/posts/emu1/14.png)
_Refrences List_

Follow it in assembly and here we find a function call just before it that took our username and key before

And followed by 5 bytes before writing ax to the memory

![Verification function call](/assets/img/posts/emu1/15.png)
_Verification function call_

Using online assembly to opcode [defuse](https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly) with this instruction `mov ax, 0xFFFF` to set value `0xFFFF` at `ax` register

The opcode of it is `66B8FFFF` and this can be written into 4 bytes but we have 5 and leaving the last byte will misinterpret the next instruction so we batch it with `0x90` opcode of no operation `nop`

To edit press `Ctrl+e`

![Patch emu](/assets/img/posts/emu1/17.png)
_Patch emu_

Apply the patch and start the patched version and suddenly it is register to `test` but how did it knows

![Registered to test](/assets/img/posts/emu1/19.png)
_Registered to test_

Looking at the emu files and file called `reg.ini` newly created and contain user name and key from our first attemp

Assume that it will read the file each time it start and check if username and key sotred in it are valid

Change the name at this file will change the name at the program ;)

# Create Patch With C

Open the patched version with `hxd` and search for `66 B8 FF FF` to get the offset of the them on the exe


![hxd](/assets/img/posts/emu1/24.png)
_hxd_

The offset is `0x1DA69D`

![offset](/assets/img/posts/emu1/25.png)
_offset_


Write a c prgram to open the exe and move to our offset

```c
unsigned char bytes[] = {0xB8, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x90};
int offset = 0x1DA69D;

FILE *fileH = fopen ("emu8086.exe", "r+");
fseek(fileH, offset, SEEK_SET)
```

After this write our bytes

```c
fwrite(&bytes, sizeof(bytes), sizeof(bytes[0]), fileH)
```

And for fun open `reg.ini` and write my name ;)

```c
char reg[] = "username=Patched By Mahmoud Ramadan\nregkey=x\nq=100";
FILE *fileH2 = fopen ("reg.ini", "w");

fwrite(&reg, sizeof(reg), sizeof(reg[0]), fileH2)
```

Test the patch and it works
