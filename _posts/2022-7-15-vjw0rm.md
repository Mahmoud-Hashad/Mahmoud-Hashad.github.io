# Vjw0rm

Sample Url: [https://bazaar.abuse.ch/](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/download/2fcb91ed942cf840ed6e2c38005f26b5bdd3d69488a018e2c23c546a66423638/)

We start with a js file the file is obfuscated  as shown in the image
and at the end is some data that looks like base64 encoded but if you try to decode it directly it will fail.

After using [de4js](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) to deobfuscate the script
and follow looking at its logic it appears to replace each match of `><` on the suspicious base46 with `A` the decode it.

and the decoded payload reveals another js script

This script will write a new `js` file at the`%APPDATA%/spHAeMTgHF.js` and run it the content of the file is the result of decoding base64 data.
And will create a new `vbs` file at `%TMP%/ejike.vbs` and run it the content of the file is the result of decoding base64 data.

I will start with the `js` file it is obfuscated as the first file so by replacing `><` with `A` and base64 decode we found another `js` script
The new script includes some weird naming and needs to be analysed

Cleaning it a bit and we can find what it does.
For presistance it uses registry `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\YVBPFHTJIQ\`
And it copies itself to the startup folder
Another registry that is used by this malware is `HKCU\vjw0rm`

Then a loop is started to communicate with the C2 in our case it was `http://franmhort[.]duia[.]ro` at port `8152` and path `Vre/`

jvw0rm includes a few commands:
- Cl: terminate the script
- Sc: write file to `%tmp%` dir and run it
- Ex: eval JScript
- Rn: overwrite `VN` variable with a new value and re-run the script
- Un: it is not clear but appears to do something related to the registry key `YVBPFHTJIQ` could be updated
- RF: the same as Cl

Looking at the `vbs` file and it appears that this is the worm
it will copy itself to startup, temp folders and add itself to
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run\<script name>`
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsof\windows\currentversion\run\<script name>`
then enumerate all files and folders on the system and create a shortcut for them and inject itself to run when each one is used

the worm provides some ready function like a trojan:
- execute: run vbs scripts
- uninstall: remove the worm and reverse all that it did \[could be used to build removal script\]
- send: download file from c2
- site-send: download file from any site
- recv: upload file to c2
- enum-driver: enumerate drivers
- enum-faf: enumerate folder
- enum-process: enumerate processes
- cmd-shell: start cmd shell
- delete: delete file or folder
- exit-process: terminate process
- sleep: sleep ;)

worm c2:
- host: 194.5.97.7
- port: 4040
